heroku-worker
=============

An example of how to run background tasks in heroku using 
javascript (node.js) and phantomjs, among other things.

Specifically [phantom.commute.js](bin/phantom.commute.js) shows how to use 
[phantom.js](http://phantomjs.org/), a headless browser, to 

1. Fetch a page. In this case, google directions between any two addresses
1. Extract data. In this case, the driving time including traffic
1. Store that data in stathat.  In this case,
[view driving times between Chicago Bean and O'Hare](http://chadn.github.com/heroku-worker/test/ord.html)

## Setup

Before getting started, you must have

* A free stathat account ([create](https://stathat.com/sign_in/))
* A free heroku account ([sign up](http://www.heroku.com/))
* Locally installed heroku toolbelt 
* Locally installed git ([setup git and github](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git))
* Locally installed phantomjs ([download and install](http://phantomjs.org/download.html))


### Setup Git 

First, clone this git repository

	$ git clone git://github.com/chadn/heroku-worker.git

Make sure phantomjs is working.

	$ cd heroku-worker
	$ phantomjs bin/phantom.hello.js
	Hello, world!

Copy and Edit the config file, using your stathat info and your addresses.

	$ cp conf/commute.ord.js conf/commute.js
	$ open conf/commute.js

Commit those changes to git

	$ git add conf/commute.js
	$ git commit

### Setup Heroku

Now we'll create a heroku app, and set up cron-like tasks to accomplish our goal.

I use `node-worker` for the heroku app name, you will need to choose your own name.

	$ heroku apps:create node-worker
	Creating node-worker... done, stack is cedar
	http://node-worker.herokuapp.com/ | git@heroku.com:node-worker.git
	Git remote heroku added
	
Test that it works, it should take a few seconds to run.

	$ git push heroku master
	...
	$ heroku run node_modules/phantomjs/bin/phantomjs bin/phantom.commute.js conf/commute.js

Assuming you see 'success' in the output, and no lines with 'error',
everything is working so far!

### Setup Heroku Scheduler

Now add and configure the heroku scheduler so it can be run every 5 mins

	$ heroku addons:add scheduler:standard
	Adding scheduler:standard on node-worker... done, v4 (free)
	This add-on consumes dyno hours, which could impact your monthly bill. To learn more:
	http://devcenter.heroku.com/addons_with_dyno_hour_usage
	To manage scheduled jobs run:
	heroku addons:open scheduler
	Use `heroku addons:docs scheduler:standard` to view documentation.
	$ heroku addons:open scheduler

That last line should open your browser where you add your job.  In the browser,
click `Add Job...`, choose frequency of every 10 mins, and enter this as the Task:

	$ node_modules/phantomjs/bin/phantomjs bin/phantom.commute.js conf/commute.js

Note that is the same thing we typed after `heroku run` previously. See how easy that is?

To get it to run every 5 mins, you must wait exactly 5 mins after you entered the last 10 min task,
and enter the same task again.  Now you have 2 identical tasks running every 10 mins, 5 mins apart,
which is the same as running the task every 5 mins. 


### Confirm Setup

Lastly, confirm everything is working.  

First we'll just use heroku to tail the log lines.  

	$ heroku logs -t -n 100

The above statement might not show much if your task has not run yet.
To check when the task runs, look for `Last Run` and `Next Run` in the
[scheduler dashboard](https://heroku-scheduler.herokuapp.com/dashboard).
Once it runs, you should see output in the logs.

Additionally you can check the logs from your browser, too.
Just add the papertrail addon.

	$ heroku addons:add papertrail
	Adding papertrail on node-worker... done, v5 (free)
	Welcome to Papertrail. Questions and ideas are welcome. Happy logging!
	Use `heroku addons:docs papertrail` to view documentation.

You can now access the logs from a browser.  Click on the papertrail addon
from your app's dashboard.  Here's the dashboard for my node-worker
https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/node-worker/resources

## BONUS

1. Create more conf/*.js files, commit, push to heroku, and add task to scheduler.
1. Publish your code to github - 
[Sign Up](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git) or just 
[Create Repository](https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo)
1. [Create a html page in github](https://help.github.com/categories/20/articles)

## Notes

Tested on Mac OSX 10.8 and heroku cedar (Ubuntu linux 10.04)
